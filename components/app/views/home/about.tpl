<h3>About Silk</h3>

<p>
Silk started as an abstraction of key features from the codebase of <a href="http://cmsmadesimple.org">CMS Made Simple</a> 2.0, which is
still in development.  There were already key features in the codebase that would work weel for
other applications.  It was felt that if these pieces were abstracted from the content management
specific pieces, they could thrive and grow on their own -- while putting less burden on the
developers of the CMS.
</p>

<p>
Silk requires PHP 5.2 and above.  We make full use of most of the new features of PHP5 and especially
things that are in 5.2.0+.  Because of this, Silk is fully OOP and uses lots of these techniques to keep
the code simple, maintainable, and most importantly, it makes sense.

Silk is releaesd as open source under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT</a> license.

define some of thebest methodologies for agile web development. While Silk isn&apos;t a direct
copy, there is definitely much insipration.</p>
